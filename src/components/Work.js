            “Fairytales and Conspiracies” is a series of animated digital
            collages that are deeply rooted in the surrealist tradition. Using
            typographic elements that are quotes of Max Frisch’s book
            “questionnaire” the pieces raises thought-provoking questions about
            the state of our world and the individual in today’s society.
          </p>

          <p className="work__paragraph">
            While collages traditionally are based on found imagery print media,
            Rehberger created these collages digitally, using the image stock of
            one of the biggest image archives in the world: venture partner
            action press international.

          <p className="work__paragraph">
            When offered the possibility to publish these collages as NFTs,
            Rehberger developed a unique concept for them, unprecedented in the
            art world: By animating the collages he created “liquid posters” in
            which the compositions of the collages are constantly in motion as
            elements float, turn, grow, shrink and travel across the image pane
            in loops ranging from 18 to 36 seconds.
          </p>

          <p className="work__paragraph">
            With these artworks, Rehberger has found a way to combine many
            elements and motifs well known to his oeuvre with a clever new use
            of the technological advantages NFTs offer, to create a unique
            concept for this digital artwork. “Fairytales and Conspiracies” taps
            into a subject that has been central to Rehberger’s work since the
            beginning of his career: the position of the artist in the process
            of authorship. While an NFT’s main benefit, in the context of art,
            is to certify the originality of a (digital) work of art, Rehberger
            questions it by handing over the final decision about the artistic
            composition to the buyer, letting them decide which configuration of
            the collaged elements should be their “original Rehberger”. Owning
            such a solidified “liquid poster” as an NFT - including a digital
            image of the frame as well as a paper-printed poster with autograph
            signature - touches on the question of what is an authentic and
            original artwork.

            and recorded by renowned electronic musician Markus Nikolai.
